# Concepts

- Centralized Global State (State Container)
- Prop Drilling (The problem solved by Redux)
- Reducers (Functions to change the state immutably)
- Root Reducer (Combination of multiple specific Reducers)
- Actions (Objects with Type and Payload to describe events)
- Action Creators (Functions that generate the Action object)
- Dispatch (Method to send Actions to the Reducers)
- useSelector (Hook to access the Global State in components)
- useDispatch (Hook to dispatch Actions from components)
- Unidirectional Data Flow (The Redux cycle: View -> Action -> Reducer -> State)
- Action Types (Constants to uniquely identify each Action)
- Selectors (Functions to calculate derived data from the State, e.g., Total Price)
- Immutability (Golden rule: never modify the State, always return a new one)
- Redux Toolkit (RTK) (Modern tool for simplifying the setup)
- createSlice (RTK: Creates Reducer, Actions, and Types all at once)
- configureStore (RTK: Creates the Store with best practices and middlewares)
- Redux Logger (Debugging middleware to visualize the State flow)
- Business Logic in the Reducer (Best practice for centralizing data update logic)
